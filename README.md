Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are community groups for college students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or postgraduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their communities. 

In 2021, GDSC will be present at Makassar State University (UNM) for the first time. This is a great opportunity for all UNM students from all majors and study programs to be able to learn and collaborate together in the field of technology. We create open source project where everyone can contribute.
